## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi, I'm Matthew Chiaradio, a Computer Science senior with a Mathematics minor at the University of South Florida, graduating in May 2025. Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering, problem-solving, and creating solutions that make an impact.

With experience in C#, JavaScript, and web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Vue.js, I've built various projects from stock market visualization tools to simulation models in AnyLogic. I'm particularly interested in optimization algorithms, CUDA programming, and backend systems.

Iâ€™ve had hands-on experience with tools like SQL, Git, and Agile methodologies, and Iâ€™m always looking to learn new technologies and techniques. I enjoy working collaboratively on challenging projects, and I strive to build clean, efficient code while constantly pushing myself to improve.
