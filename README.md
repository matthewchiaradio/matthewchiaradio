## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Chiaradio, a senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of South Florida, set to graduate in May 2025. My journey into tech started early, with an interest in hardware that quickly evolved into software development. Since then, Iâ€™ve been passionate about learning, building, and optimizing software solutions.

Throughout my academic career, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience in various programming languages and technologies, including C#, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and CUDA programming. My work spans web development, desktop applications, and simulation modeling, with a focus on creating scalable, efficient, and user-friendly systems.

Some of my key projects include:
  - A stock market visualization tool built using C# Windows Forms, where I implemented data binding, dynamic filtering, and pattern recognition.
  - A simulation project with the United States Air Force, using AnyLogic for process mapping and optimization, where I integrated database management and GUI features.
  - A web scraping tool for NBA statistics, leveraging Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup library to gather and analyze player performance data.

Iâ€™ve also developed a strong understanding of concepts like database management, algorithm design, and optimization. Iâ€™m comfortable working with SQL, Git, and various software development methodologies, including Agile.

I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others to solve complex problems, and I believe in writing clean, maintainable code. In addition to my technical skills, Iâ€™m a huge sports fan (especially basketball), and I bring that same passion and determination to everything I do.
